;; Of course you can write a much better query by *understanding* its
;; intention (shown below). But it is interesting that you don't *have* to
;; understand the query to find problems by reordering or removing
;; clauses. You could even write a program to do it for you.


;; Anayzing the Query based on domain knowledge

;; 1. Lots of datoms match [?e1 :a ?v1]
;; 2. Lots of daotms match [?e2 :a ?v2]
;; 3. 1 & 2 have no vars in common, so this makes a cross-product. Danger!
;; 4. Very few datoms match [?e1 :a 10]
;; 5. Given 4, 1 is not needed at all
;; 6. Very few datoms match [?e2 :a ?e1]
;; 7. Given 6, 2 is not needed at all
;; 8. Given 4 & 6, ?e1 is known at input time
;; So:
(d/q {:query '[:find ?e1 ?e2
               :in $ ?e1
               :where [?e2 :a ?e1]]
      :args [db e]
      :timeout 10000})
