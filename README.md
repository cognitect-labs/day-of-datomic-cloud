# day-of-datomic-cloud

Day of Datomic Cloud project is a collection of samples and tutorials
for learning [Datomic Cloud](https://www.datomic.com) at a Clojure REPL.

## Getting Started

* Install Clojure:
```
$ brew install clojure
```

* [Install Datomic dev-local](https://docs.datomic.com/cloud/dev-local.html).

* [Install the datomic-samples databases](https://docs.datomic.com/cloud/examples.html#datomic-samples).

* Start a Clojure REPL in the day-of-datomic-cloud directory:
